This is a simple app that enables the user to see map 
pinpoints of types of city features nearby, such as 
parks, schools, firehouses, and so on. It uses the 
Chris Metcalf's SODAKit swift library (https://github.com/socrata/soda-swift)
to connect to seattle.data.gov for city feature 
information.
